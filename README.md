_WG1s primary intention is to lower barriers in E-AI activities data usage by analysing available and missing data holdings, obstacles in using them, and creating examples of using and converting the data into a suitable form for Machine Learning. The considered applications cover weather forecasting (from nowcasting to seasonal), climate applications, and downstream products and services_

The group does a gap analysis of used and missing data in AI/ML applications relevant to E-AI content, rcognising the datasets and considering why they are used or not used.
