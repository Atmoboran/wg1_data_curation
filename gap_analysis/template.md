Following is the description of use cases with data needs and sources. 

Contributors are asked to copy the template and add their use case to the document. 

## Use case template

Very short description + [url](README.md)

### Used training data

Please copy the underlying table for each used dataset and fulfil from applicable parts. Don't worry! It does not need to be complete! 

Please note that also non-publicly available datasets are in scope as well.

| Topic | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Data source** | Short description + [url to data source](README.md) |
| **Data content** <br> (parameters / products / levels / etc.) | As accurate list of the content as possible. Notably, we can't use very specific terminology because different domains use different vocabulary (e.g. channels vs. paramaters vs. variables vs. products) |
| **Geospatial resolution**| e.g. 2x2km or 0.05 deg |
| **Temporal resolution**| e.g. 5 min regular, or in average of 2 times per day |
| **Data format**| Available and used data formats |
| **Preferred data format** | Preferred data format if any |
| **Preferred data access mechanism** | Preferred access mechanism if any |
| **Data preprocessing** | Short description of preprocessing and used tools|
| **Reason for usage** | Short description why this data were used |
| **Challeneges** | If you have occured some challenges in using the data, please describe them here |

### Missing data
