| Topic | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Data source** | Short description + [url to data source](README.md) |
| **Data content** <br> (parameters / products / levels / etc.) | As accurate list of the content as possible. Notably, we can't use very specific terminology because different domains use different vocabulary (e.g. channels vs. paramaters vs. variables vs. products) |
| **Data format**| Available and used data formats |
| **Preferred data format** | Preferred data format if any |
| **Preferred data access mechanism** | Preferred access mechanism if any |
| **Data preprocessing** | Short description of preprocessing |
| **Challeneges** | If you have occured some challenges in using the data, please describe them here |
