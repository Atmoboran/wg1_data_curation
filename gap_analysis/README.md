    - Push your branch to the remote repository (e.g. `git push origin my-modest-agi`)
    - Go to the repository on GitHub and create a new pull request
 
 ####  2. Pull request via a fork

If you are not a contributor in the repository, you can follow the process via [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork):

4. Create a pull request, e.g. following the tasks:
    - Commit your changes (e.g. `git commit -am "Add my-modest-agi use case"`)
    - Push your branch to the remote repository (e.g. `git push`)
    - Go to the original repository on GitHub and create a new pull request from fork
