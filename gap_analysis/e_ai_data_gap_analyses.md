# Data Gap Analysis for Weather and Climate-Related AI/ML Applications

## 1. Summary
- Keep short enough

## 2. Introduction

1 paragraph of background

### 2.1 Purpose and Scope
(1 paragraph)

- to find most important missing data
- to find technical and content-related obstacles in using the data
- possibly to be extended to data inventory in the future (more about future avenues in Chapter xx)

### 2.3 Methodology
(1 or 2 paragaphs)

- WG composition and meetings 
- Use case data collection
- Dataset data collection (other documents, do we do anything else?)
- Writing of this report


## 3. Data Requirements
This chapter handles key requirements for data based on the use case analyses.

### 3.1 Key Use Cases
- List of use cases identified / analysed in this work (per category perhaps?)

### 3.2 Data Categories
- Meteorological data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).
- Climate data (e.g., long-term trends, sea-level changes).
- Environmental data (e.g., land cover, aerosols).
- Socioeconomic data (for impact and adaptation modeling).

### 3.3 Data Characteristics
- Spatial resolution.
- Temporal resolution.
- Accuracy and reliability.
- Coverage (global, regional, local).


## 4. Current Data Inventory

Repeat following for:
- Reanalysis 
- NWP data
- Ground-based observations
- Satellite data
- Impact data

### 4.1 Reanalyses

1-2 sentence definition of data

- **Available data sources**
    - List / table of available data sourcees with a link
- **Data services**
    - How available (data API / S3 / ftp / not available / etc.)
    - Restrictions in availability (only in HPC / EWC / etc, only for certain users...)
- **License**:
    - Restrictions in availability (only in HPC / EWC / etc, only for certain users...)
- **Obstacles in Usage**:
  -  Whatever comes up in the use case analyses

### 4.x. Summary of obstacles
- If we have enough content, we can add summary table of problems 

## 5. Identification of Data Gaps

List missing data or significant content-related shortcomings for existing data. For each: 

- **Data Description**:
  - Description of data content (variables / parameters / etc.)
- **Resolution**:
  - Lack of resolution for use case xx
- **Coverage**:
  - Lack of coverage for use case xx
- **Obstacles in Usage**:
  - Whatever comes out from the analyses, some guesses: 
    - Data services not available or not usabe
    - Data too complex to use in given time (why?)
    - Licensing
    - ... 

## 6. Conclusion

1-2 paragraphs to summary (or we keep only executive summary in the top?)

## 7. Futureu avenues

- This version was done very quickly, continue gathering data for this and update
- Add:
    - Usage examples
    - Tools to handle and convert data to AI-ready form
    - Quality analyses ?
    - what else?
