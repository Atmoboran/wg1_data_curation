## Summary
This Data Gap Analysis for Weather and Climate-Related AI/ML Applications is part of the EUMETNET Artificial Intelligence (E-AI) Working Group 1 ('Data Curation') activities. Its primary goal is to identify key data requirements, gaps, and obstacles hindering the effective use of weather and climate data for AI/ML-based applications. 

Key data gaps include missing datasets such as cloud fraction data from high-resolution LEO satellites for Northern Europe and comprehensive icing observations in gridded formats. Additionally, long training datasets for MTG FCI and LI data as well as European-wide weather radar products like echo tops and hail detection remain unavailable.

Obstacles to data usage include slow download speeds, exotic and inconsistent data formats and time steps, lacking or complex geo-referencing, licensing restrictions, and incomplete temporal/geospatial coverage. The lack of real-time equivalents to Climate Data Records (CDRs) further limits AI/ML training capabilities.

Future avenues of this work include expanding the data inventory, providing usage examples, and curating best practices to make weather and climate data more AI-ready. Contributions and feedback from the community are encouraged to further refine this living document and support advancements in AI/ML applications for weather and climate science.

## Introduction

This analyses is part of EUMETNET Artificial Intelligence (E-AI) working group 1 ('data curation') activities. The goal of this document is to provide an overview of the data requirements and most significant gaps and obstacles in data usage in the context of weather and climate-related AI/ML applications. 

The document is composed by European  hydro-meteorological services and related reserarch organisations. The analyses is based on the use cases and data sources provided for this and other E-AI working groups and edited by the working group faciliators. The document is meant to be a living document and updated regularly.

## Data Requirements of Identified Use Cases
This chapter handles key requirements for data based on the use case analyses.

### Key Use Cases

This chapter summaries [use cases](./use_cases/) provided by the WG members along with known use cases from other sources. The goal is to provide an overview of the characteristics of the use cases to identify commonalities and key challenges in data usage.

<!-- Applications summary (table below), possibly to be divided per category in the future:
  - Meteorological data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).
  - Climate data (e.g., long-term trends, sea-level changes).
  - Environmental data (e.g., land cover, aerosols).
  - Socioeconomic data (for impact and adaptation modeling). -->

### Joined Characteristics

There are no enough use cases to draw trustwrothy synthesis, but preliminary folllowing things can be stated: 

- Preferred access mechanism is S3
- Preferred data format is controversial
- Temporal and geospatial resolution varies greatly depending on the use cases

## Current Data Inventory

This chapter list most typically used data sources for E-AI applications with necessary details to identify potential challenges with existing data or missing data. Readers are invited to add their data source to the tables.

Also [MLCast](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iknFj36XdV19udaIsYJhVJLv2Hq-ARjO85jD0jfrYqw/edit?usp=sharing) and [ML LAM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KzMHjl08ESMSpEwJ1eopbWfBp_2MXL-XL63KljWQCZU/edit?usp=sharing) working group documents list typically used datasets. 

### 4.1 Reanalyses
<<<<<<< HEAD

To be written
=======
Reanalyses are a key dataset for early ML, since they provide a gridded physically consistent dataset that has no spatial (neither in the vertical nor in the horizontal) or temporal gap.
#### 4.1.1. ERA5 
1-2 sentence definition of data
>>>>>>> 16b1c88 (Update e_ai_data_gap_analyses.md)


<<<<<<< HEAD
### Weather radar data
Weather radar data are available at least from following sources:
=======
#### 4.1.x. ICON-DREAM - "future"
ICON-DREAM (ICON-Dual resolution Reanalysis for Emulators, Applications and Monitoring) utilize the global ICON NWP framework from DWD, that has an additional two-way coupled nest over Europe. This  reanalysis has resolution of 13km globally and 6.5 km over Europe and 120 vertical levels. Its operational data assimilation cycle comprises an EnVar at 3-hourly intervals complemented by a snow analysis every 3 hours, and T2M, SST and soil moisture analysis every 24 hours (at 00 UTC). The background error covariances are provided by a 20 member ensemble at 40km global and 20km over Europe with a LETKF-based data assimilation scheme.
The reanalysis currently covers the period from 2010 to today with a continuous extension to the current time. Plans include the back-extension starting in 1979.

- **Available data sources**
    - 111 hourly variables for the deterministic and all ensembles, including their European nests. Data sharing procedure: work in progress given the high volume (0.4 PB/year).
- **Data services**
    - How available: some variables will be on a publicly accessible ftp server.
    - Restrictions in availability: for now, only on HPC.
- **License**:
    - Restrictions in availability (only in HPC / EWC / etc, only for certain users...)
- **Obstacles in Usage**:
  -  Whatever comes up in the use case analyses

Following missing data were identified: 
- Fog prediction data is well-known challenge
- Cloud fraction data from LEO satellites providing high-enough resolution in Northern Europe are missing 
- Icing observations preferably in gridded format and for multiple levels for Norhern Europe are missing
- Long-enough training dataset for MTG FCI and LI-data 
- Missing weather radar products such as echo tops, VIL, and hail prodcuts covering the whole Europe

Moreover, imapct data such as flood, drought, and windstorm data were not yet analysed but it's clear that they are widely missing or only available as proprietary data.

 ### Obstacles in Usage

Following remarkable obastacles in usage were identified:

- Slow download and need to uncompress data after downloading (i.e. for satellite data)
- Exotic and varying data formats
- License restrictions i.e. for some satellite data
- Varying and inconcistent time steps and resolutions. All data is not geo-referenced
- Climate Data Records (CDRs) are great source for training but there's no always corresponding real-time data available
- Limited coverage of data sources / fragmented data sources

## Future avenues

As noted, the current version is done in very limited time and collecting use cases and data sources is still ongoing. More data presumably provides more insight to the data gaps and obstacles in usage.

Moreover, the future avenues for this work may also include extension of the content, including:

- Usage examples (e.g. Jupyter notebooks) 
- List and analyses of tools to handle and convert data to AI-ready form
- Best practices ('do/donts') for the different data types and sources, collected both from data providers and consumers
- Quality analyses of the data sources

**We thank all contributors for their instrumental input and feedback!**

We are looking forward to see more contributions from both data providers and consumers. 
We are also very happy to see hear your feedback and ideas for the future avenues of this work.
