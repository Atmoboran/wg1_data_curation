## Weather front forecasts (gridded)

Fronts are often connected to relevant weather and at many weather services hand drawn using model and other synoptic data.
This task is labour intensive and could be supported by providing AI produced front analysis.
DWD trained an AI front prediction system (U-Net) using a large set of hand drawn, machine readable front analysis as training label data.
The model output is a pixel map. Each pixel is given a probability to be classified either as cold-, warm-, occluded or no front.
