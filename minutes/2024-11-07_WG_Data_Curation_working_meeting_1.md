## Minutes

Existing known projects and available / required data: 

- [Nowcasting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iknFj36XdV19udaIsYJhVJLv2Hq-ARjO85jD0jfrYqw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.g7k4377ea9do) - Already lists many data sets identified as being essential for training, but still preliminary and likely to grow.

- [ML LAM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KzMHjl08ESMSpEwJ1eopbWfBp_2MXL-XL63KljWQCZU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.66rsmcqr6xup) - Lists many relevant reanalysis data sets.

We need to raise awareness of each afford collecting information about these data sets. Needs to be discussed with both groups.

Our contribution can be to collect and define use cases and analysis the data needs and focus on delivering for the first milestone.

[A first use case template](../gap_analysis/template.md) has been proposed. Collects information on data required for training and interference. Needs a field to add what data is missing. Also perhaps collect information on tools specifically required to use the data. Also, add note that non-public datasets are in interest as well. 

Approach all participants of the kick-off meeting to contribute their use cases. EUMETSAT and ECMWF will collect EWC use cases. We need to give motivation for contributors to show the benefit of their efforts. 

Discussion on practical setup. Discussion between GitHub and Google Docs. Group preferred Github as a better tool to have a tracked discussion on contributions. Interactive meetings notes stay in Google Docs and move when agreed to GitHub.

Could this group be a contact point for users looking for data sources? Yes, we should connect people. Will be added to instructions and will be one of the motivations for others to contribute.

How many use cases do we need? 
- As many as possible

## Next steps
- Roope to update the template
- Roope to onboard others to github as maintainer
- Roope to formulate an invitation (all welcome to comment!)
- Everyone to send the invitation to their contacts
- Roope EUMETSAT side of the EWC use cases
- Stephan ECMWF â€¦
- Marek to send the invitation to contribute to E-AI 
- Everyone to add your own use cases
- Roope, Stephan and Arianna to prepare analysis document structure
